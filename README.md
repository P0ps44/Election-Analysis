# Election Audit

## Overview of Project
     
     The purpose of this analysis was to make a dataset that compiled a clientâ€™s stock market data.
Although the code worked, this project specifically will further improve the code for the client by 
refactoring the code.

## Summary
       
     The refactor code ran faster by using more output arays and nested loops. 
This can be advantages for many different stock analysis, but if the data was more complicated, 
it would be better to run it the 1st way. Ran into a few errors in the code, 
but it was an easy fix since the code was shorter. VBA doesn't have a good debug system so my opinion would to leave more arays for other coding programs.
