## Election Audit Summary

So thanks to this script made in Python, 369,711 rows of data were compiled to show which county had the largest turnout.
By deleting or adding data to the election_results.cvs, you can add more votes for different elections.

You can go beyond that and use the actually script to output different data. For example, if a candidate wanted to know how many votes they were behind the winner, you could add a if statement near the end of the script. You could also add a statement that determines the lowest county turnout.
